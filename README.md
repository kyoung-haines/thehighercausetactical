# The Higher Cause Tactial Group
What is The Higher Cause Tactical Group?

It is a gaming clan (or more appropriately termed, "unit") for the Arma Platform. Units are the functional equivalent of a clan in the Armaverse, and they are a way for likeminded players to group together and play together consistently. There is no comparison between the quality of gameplay solo (or even with randoms, as good as that can get) and the quality of gameplay from playing with a group that is cohesive and used to playing together. Our aim is to provide a place where players can expect support and grouping, to create and foster a fun, engaged, and enjoyable Arma experience, without taking ourselves too seriously.

# Purpose
This is the home of an Arma Platform gaming clan - The Higher Cause Tactical Group. The website will act as a central hub for everything related to the clan. 
It will feature an application page, which people will be able to apply to the clan, based on certain criteria (criteria may depend on which branch the application is for; more on branches below).

# Design
The website's design will be relatively minimalistic with a darker aesthetic. The clan's colour scheme is red, white, and black, so the website's design
will follow a similar colour scheme for fluid styling.

The website will incorporate a military/covert feel to the site how it can (typography, verbiage, etc).
